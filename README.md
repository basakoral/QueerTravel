# QueerTravel

**QueerTravel** is an interactive visualization tool designed to support safer travel decision-making for queer individuals by integrating formal social safety indicators with community-contributed lived experiences.

Discrimination at travel destinations can significantly affect the wellbeing and freedom of queer travelers, often resulting in exclusion, restricted self-expression, or even physical harm. While prior research has highlighted these risks and associated coping strategies, available information remains scattered and difficult to act upon.

To address this gap, we conducted interviews with queer travelers to identify key factors that shape their perceptions of social safety, along with their broader informational needs. Drawing from these insights, **QueerTravel** provides a visual decision-support system that presents curated safety data across 203 countries.

The tool combines:
- Legal and institutional safety indicators (e.g., same-sex marriage status, non-binary recognition, transgender murder rates, morality laws)
- Community-generated travel experiences to enrich the narrative with real, situated voices

Users can explore a **map-based overview** and **tabular comparisons**, and contribute their own experiences through a mobile-friendly input interface. This combination fosters a more inclusive, empowering approach to travel planningâ€”moving the narrative from risk toward **participation, safety, and empowerment**.
